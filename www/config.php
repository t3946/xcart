# This section sets up a connection between X-Cart shopping cart software
# and your MySQL database. If X-Cart is installed using Web installation, the
# variables of this section are configured via the Installation Wizard. If you
# install X-Cart manually, or if, after X-Cart has been installed, your MySQL
# server information changes, use this section to provide database access
# information manually.
#
# $sql_host - DNS name or IP of your MySQL server;
# $sql_user - MySQL user name;
# $sql_db - MySQL database name;
# $sql_password - MySQL password.
#

# X-Cart HTTP & HTTPS host and web directory
#
# This section defines the location of your X-Cart installation. If X-Cart is 
# installed using Web installation, the variables of this section are 
# configured via the Installation Wizard. If you install X-Cart manually, use 
# this section to provide your web server details manually.
#
# $xcart_http_host - Host name of the server on which your X-Cart software is 
# to be installed;
# $xcart_https_host - Host name of the secure server that will provide access
# to your X-Cart-based store via the HTTPS protocol;
# $xcart_web_dir - X-Cart web directory.
#
# NOTE:
# The variables $xcart_http_host and $xcart_https_host must contain hostnames 
# ONLY (no http:// or https:// prefixes, no trailing slashes).
#
# Web dir is the directory where your X-Cart is installed as seen from the Web,
# not the file system.
#
# Web dir must start with a slash and have no slash at the end. An exception to
# this rule is when you install X-Cart in the site root, in which case you need
# to leave the variable empty.
#
# EXAMPLE 1:
# $xcart_http_host ="www.yourhost.com";
# $xcart_https_host ="www.securedirectories.com/yourhost.com";
# $xcart_web_dir ="/xcart";
# will result in the following URLs:
# http://www.yourhost.com/xcart
# https://www.securedirectories.com/yourhost.com/xcart
#
# EXAMPLE 2:
# $xcart_http_host ="www.yourhost.com";
# $xcart_https_host ="www.yourhost.com";
# $xcart_web_dir ="";
# will result in the following URLs:

# Storing Customers' Credit Card Info
#
# The variable $store_cc defines whether you want the credit card info provided
# by your customers at checkout to be stored in the database or not. 
# The credit card info that can be stored includes:
# - Cardholder's name;
# - Card type;
# - Card number;
# - Valid from (for certain card types);
# - Exp. date;
# - Issue No (for certain card types).
#
# Admissible values for $store_cc are 'true' and 'false':
# 'true' - X-Cart will store your customers' credit card info in the order
# details and user profiles;
# 'false' - X-Cart will not store your customers' credit card info anywhere.
#
# NOTE:
# If you are going to use 'Subscription' module, set $store_cc to 'true'.
#
$store_cc = false;

# Storing CVV2 codes
#
# The variable $store_cvv2 defines whether you want the CVV2 codes of your
# customers' credit cards to be stored in the database or not.
#
# Admissible values for $store_cvv2 are 'true' and 'false':
# 'true' - X-Cart will store the CVV2 codes of your customers' credit cards
# in the order details and user profiles;
# 'false' - X-Cart will not store the CVV2 codes of your customers' credit
# cards anywhere.
#
# NOTE:
# VISA International does not recommend storing CVV2 codes along with credit
# card numbers.
# If you are going to use 'Subscription' module, set $store_cvv2 to 'true'.
#
$store_cvv2 = false;

# Storing Customers' Checking Account Details 
#
# The variable $store_ch defines whether you want your customers checking
# account details to be stored in the database or not.
# The checking account details that can be stored include: 
# - Bank account number;
# - Bank routing number;
# - Fraction number.

#
# Admissible values for $store_ch are 'true' and 'false':

# order details;
# 'false' - X-Cart will not store your customers' checking account details 
# anywhere.

# Default images
#
# The variable $default_image defines which image file should be used as the

# place of any missing image in your X-Cart-based store if no other "No image
# available"-type picture is defined for that case).
#

#
# Single Store mode (X-Cart PRO only)
#
# The variable $single_mode allows you to enable/disable Single Store mode if
# your store is based on X-Cart PRO. Single Store mode is an operation mode in
# which your store represents a unified environment shared by multiple
# providers in such a way that any provider can edit the products of the other
# providers, and shipping rates, discounts, taxes, discount coupons, etc are
# the same for all the providers.
#
# Admissible values for $single_mode are 'true' and 'false':
# 'true' - enables Single Store mode;
# 'false' - puts your store into normal mode where each of your providers can
# control his own products only and can have shipping rates, discounts, taxes,
# etc different from those of the other providers.
#
# NOTE:
# If your store is based on X-Cart GOLD, $single_mode must be set to 'true' at
# all times.

# Caching
#
# The constant USE_DATA_CACHE defines whether you want to use data caching in

# Admissible values for USE_DATA_CACHE are 'true' and 'false'.
# By default, the value of this constant is set to 'true'. You can set it to

# The variable $blowfish_key contains your Blowfish encryption key automatically
# generated by X-Cart during installation. This key is used to encrypt all the
# sensitive data in your store including user passwords, credit card data, etc. 
#
# NEVER try to change your Blowfish encryption key by editing the value  of the
# $blowfish_key variable in this file: your data is already encrypted with this
# key and X-Cart needs exactly the same key to be able to decrypt it. Changing
# $blowfish_key manually will corrupt all the user passwords (including the
# administrator's password), so you will not be able to use the store. 
#
# Please be aware that a lost Blowfish key cannot be restored, so X-Cart team
# will not be able to help you regain access to your store if you remove or
# change the value of $blowfish_key.
#
# It is quite safe to use X-Cart with the Blowfish key generated during
# installation; however, if you still want to change it, please refer to
# X-Cart Reference Manual or contact X-Cart Tech Support for details.
