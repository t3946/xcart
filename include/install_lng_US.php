Before you proceed to using {{product}}, please restore secure permissions for the file config.php and your {{product}} installation directory. Issue the commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod 644 config.php<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod 755 .<br />
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT!</b> We strongly recommend you remove {{product}} distribution package from your web directory to prevent unauthorized access to {{product}} source code.<br />

You can use install.php to change the skin set or to completely re-install {{product}}. If you think you are not going to need this, you can delete the install.php installation script.<br />

In the process of installation the following security keys have been generated:<br /><br />

<li>Auth code: <b>{{installation_auth_code}}</b><br />
<li>Blowfish key: <b>{{blowfish_key}}</b><br />
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br />
Auth code will be used to prevent unauthorized access to {{product}} installation script install.php. If, in the future, you decide to completely re-install {{product}}, change your store\'s skin set or install some {{product}} add-ons, you will be required to enter this code at the time of installation. Please be aware that this code is stored for you in include/install.php.<br />
<p>
Blowfish key will be used to encrypt all sensitive data in your store including user passwords, order details, etc. This code is supposed to be stored permanently in config.php (the variable $blowfish_key). Please DO NOT change this key manually.<br />
